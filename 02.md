# Understand state management in Kubernetes

When we talk about applications in general, you'll hear the words application state often. First, you need to understand what the state is and what the types of states are so you can better prepare your application for handling that.

## State

The state of the application is everything that's stored in memory by the time the application is running. A state can have different kinds of things, but we're mostly talking about user data.

To give an example of application state, imagine you have a music player opened. This application has a state. It knows who you are, what you like to hear, and what music you've downloaded. All this information composes part of the application state.

The in-memory state is the information that the application doesn't need to look for anywhere else. The disk state contains the information that the application doesn't have at hand, so it needs to retrieve that from another data source.

## Types of states

There are two types of application states. The first type is the ephemeral state, which isn't persistent and will vanish as soon as the application is closed.

Containers have an ephemeral state because all the data that's stored within their bounds is instantly lost when a container is deleted. Some applications can work with that alone, because they can regenerate the state from other sources and don't need the state to be stored locally. Those applications are called stateless applications.

In contrast, all the state that isn't ephemeral is called persistent state. It continues to exist after the life cycle of a container. Most container technologies that we use (like Docker) have the concept of volume, an in-disk location where the state exists. So, even if you remove the container and then turn it back on, the state remains stored in a safe location and can be used once again.

Applications that rely on an external state to be retrieved are called stateful applications.

## States and Kubernetes

Kubernetes has ways to deal both with stateless and stateful applications. Dealing with stateless apps is easier because we can focus only on the application itself and not on its state (which doesn't exist).

For most stateless applications, a simple deployment workload with a pod would be enough for you to have a fully functioning system and to make the most of your cluster.

Dealing with stateful applications is the opposite. In these cases, you'll need to worry about both the application and its state, where the state is stored, and how can you store the state securely and reliably.

This is why Kubernetes also has the concept of PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

Tip

This module won't discuss the storage concept further, but you can check out all the aspects of storage within Azure Kubernetes Service in the summary.

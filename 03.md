## **Exercise 1: Host a new database by using Azure Cosmos DB**

### **Task 1: Create the state**

As we described earlier, handling state in Kubernetes is possible. However, we don't recommend it because managing a highly available application state gets too difficult when you need to manage the state yourself.

To solve that problem, we'll externalize the state to an application that specializes in dealing with external state. We'll use Azure Cosmos DB.

> **Note:** Although we're creating an Azure Cosmos DB instance as part of the required resources to run the application, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Cosmos DB are not related to one another.

1. Create Bash variables to store important information like the account name and resource group name:

```Bash

export RESOURCE_GROUP=[sandbox resource group name]
export COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT_NAME=contoso-ship-manager-$RANDOM
Create a new Azure Cosmos DB account:
```

2. Create a new Azure Cosmos DB account:

```Bash

az cosmosdb create --name $COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --kind MongoDB
```

The creation process can take a few moments to complete.

3. Check if the creation has finished by creating a new database and listing it:
 
```Bash
az cosmosdb mongodb database create --account-name $COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name contoso-ship-manager
```
Then, list the databases by using the list command:

```Bash
az cosmosdb mongodb database list --account-name $COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
```

Now that you've created an external state to store all the data from the ship manager application, let's create the AKS resource to store the application itself.

### **Task 2: Create the AKS cluster**

Now you're going to deploy the AKS cluster so you can push your application image to the internet.

1. Create Bash variables to store important information like the cluster name and resource group name:

```Bash
export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME=ship-manager-cluster
```

2. Run the AKS creation script:

```
az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME  \
    --node-count 3 \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --node-vm-size Standard_B2s \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --location eastus \
    --enable-addons http_application_routing
```    

The script can take a while to create the resources.

3. Download the kubectl configuration:

```Bash
az aks get-credentials --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

4. Test the configuration:

```Bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### **Deploy the application**

To create the application, you'll need to create the YAML files that will be deployed to Kubernetes.

### **Task 3: Deploy the back-end API**

You need to create three main files. Let's start by creating the deploy.yaml file for the back end.

1. Create a new file called **backend-deploy.yaml**, and then open it in your favorite editor.

2. In this file, you'll write the following deployment specification:

```yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ship-manager-backend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ship-manager-backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ship-manager-backend
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: mcr.microsoft.com/mslearn/samples/contoso-ship-manager:backend
          name: ship-manager-backend
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 250m
              memory: 256Mi
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              name: http
          env:
            - name: DATABASE_MONGODB_URI
              value: "<your database connection string>"
            - name: DATABASE_MONGODB_DBNAME
              value: ship_manager
```

3. Replace the `<your database connection string>` tag with the actual connection string from Azure Cosmos DB. You can get this connection string through the following Azure CLI script:

```Bash
az cosmosdb keys list --type connection-strings -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $COSMOSDB_ACCOUNT_NAME --query "connectionStrings[0].connectionString" -o tsv
```

4. Copy and paste it within the .yaml file to make it similar to the following code:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ship-manager-backend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ship-manager-backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ship-manager-backend
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: mcr.microsoft.com/mslearn/samples/contoso-ship-manager:backend
          name: ship-manager-backend
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 250m
              memory: 256Mi
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              name: http
          env:
            - name: DATABASE_MONGODB_URI
              value: "mongodb://YOURACCOUNTNAME:password@YOURACCOUNTNAME.documents.azure.com:PORT/?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb"
            - name: DATABASE_MONGODB_DBNAME
              value: ship_manager
```

> **Note:**

5. Save and close the file.

6. Apply the update by using the kubectl apply command:

```Bash
kubectl apply -f backend-deploy.yaml
```

To make this application available to everyone, you'll need to create a service and an ingress to take care of all traffic between the application and the world.

7. Create a new file called **backend-network.yaml**, and add the following .yaml notation:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ship-manager-backend
spec:
  selector:
    app: ship-manager-backend
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ship-manager-backend
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: addon-http-application-routing
spec:
  rules:
    - host: ship-manager-backend.DNS_ZONE
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: ship-manager-backend
              servicePort: http
```

8. Replace the `DNS_ZONE` placeholder with your cluster DNS zone. You can get that information by running the following AKS command:

```Bash
az aks show -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME -o tsv --query addonProfiles.httpApplicationRouting.config.HTTPApplicationRoutingZoneName
```

9. You'll end up with a network file that's similar to this:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ship-manager-backend
spec:
  selector:
    app: ship-manager-backend
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ship-manager-backend
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: addon-http-application-routing
spec:
  rules:
    - host: ship-manager-backend.somedns.location.aksapp.io
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: ship-manager-backend
              servicePort: http
```

10. Save and close the file.

11. Apply the update by using the kubectl apply command.

```Bash
kubectl apply -f backend-network.yaml
```

12. You can access the API through the host name that you pasted in your ingress resource. The Azure DNS zone resource can take up to five minutes to complete the DNS detection. If you can't access the API right away, wait a few minutes and try again.

13. You can check the status of the DNS zone by querying Kubernetes for the available ingresses, once the ADDRESS field is filled, it means the ingress has been deployed and it's ready to be accessed:

```Bash
kubectl get ingress
```

14. You'll get a result similar to this:

```Output
NAME                   CLASS    HOSTS                                     ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
ship-manager-backend   <none>   ship-manager-backend.dns.zone.aksapp.io   xx.xx.xx.xx    80      2m40s
```
